# Notarised Append Only Memory (NAOM)

The NAOM repo contains all the code needed to set up and interact with a local instance of the Zenotta blockchain. 
Other language options can be found here:

## Getting Started

In order to get up and running with NAOM, you can clone this repo and run the `Makefile` to set everything up for a 
development environment in Unix:

```
make
cargo build
cargo test
```

..

## Use

Running `cargo run` will currently list all assets on the local instance. NAOM is not generally intended to be 
used directly, and is instead intended to be used from other programs that require access to the blockchain data 
structure.
